          of the agro-industry that works with grains brokerage. Currently we
          have a lot of apps but i'm working on two of them: FyO Acopio & FyO
          Trade. Both of them were made with .Net, WPF and WebServices, also we
          work with SQL Server (Stored Procedures, Triggers, Functions) and
          NUnit for unitesting.
